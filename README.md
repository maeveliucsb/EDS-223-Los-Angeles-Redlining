# EDS-223-Los-Angeles-Redlining
This repo reviews redlining policy in Los Angeles and the modern impacts of historically discriminatory policy using a variety of visual and statistical tools, including line and bar plots and percentage tables. This repository relies primarily on EJscreen, GBIF bird data, and Mapping Inequality redlining data. 

If a bug is spotted-shoot me an email (maeveli@ucsb.edu) and we can figure out together what's going on. Include the code ran, the error message recieved, and a screenshot of what you're working with. I'd appreciate it if you didn't contribute to this! Its my work for a class and a record of my process for research.

I will be the sole author and contributor to this homework assignment. The assignment was written by Ruth Oliver.
